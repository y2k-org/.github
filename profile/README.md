### Leading licensing manager for Python.
- Currently under development.

## About
luna.pink is a new licensing manager for Python, currently under development by an experienced Python developer. It is designed to provide solid security for closed source Python projects and binaries, by using advanced encryption, obfuscation and control techniques.

Unlike other services such as Auth.gg and KeyAuth.win that fail at simplest security when it comes to their Python support, luna.pink ensures that your code and authentication are protected from reverse engineering and cracking.

luna.pink is made in Python, for Python and Python only, minimizing security flaws as much as possible. It also features an interactive GUI that allows you to easily create, manage and revoke licenses, as well as monitor your database and analytics.

luna.pink aims to change the way Python developers protect their work and monetize their skills, by offering a reliable, affordable and user-friendly licensing manager.
